   This is a NFT Minting Website built using React,Ethers,Hardhat so basically i have used smart contracts to provide conditions for the transaction that needs to
   be executed and also we have made using of Ethers to work with the ethereum technology and also to enable peer-to-peer transaction using metamask and also i have 
   made use of hardhat which makes it easy to work with ethereum while considering flexibility and quicken up things since it consists of different components for        editing, compiling, debugging and deploying your smart contracts and dApps, all of which work together to create a complete development environment.
   
   Make sure you have a metamask account in order to do that use ganache so that it can create fake accounts with fake ethers WARNING!!!!!! DO NOT USE REAL ETHER FOR
   THIS PROJECT and then connect it to metamask so that you can work with transaction and also make sure you install hardhat tutorials are already available in google,
   YouTube make use of it.

HAVE A LOOK HOW TO GET STARTED!!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
